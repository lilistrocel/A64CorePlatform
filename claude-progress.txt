Agent: Features #49, #301, #208 (Plant Data CRUD, CSV Template, Real DB Verification)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #49: Plant data library CRUD [PASSING]
  - Full CRUD tested via /api/v1/farm/plant-data endpoints
  - CREATE: POST with plantName, scientificName, plantType, growthCycleDays, yieldUnit etc → 201
  - READ (List): GET with search parameter → returns matching plants with pagination
  - READ (By ID): GET /{plantDataId} → returns full plant data
  - UPDATE (PATCH): Updates fields, increments dataVersion (v1→v2)
  - DELETE: Soft delete (sets isActive=false), removed from list results
  - Fixed: Default list query now excludes soft-deleted plants (isActive != false)
  - UI verified: Plant Data Library page at /farm/plants shows 48 real plants
  - Zero console errors, no mock data patterns

  - Zero mock data patterns in src/ and frontend/ (grep verified)
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- src/modules/farm_manager/services/plant_data/plant_data_repository.py:
  - get_all() now defaults to exclude isActive=False records (soft-deleted plants)
  - Previously, default list showed all plants including soft-deleted ones

CURRENT STATUS: 43/310 features passing (13.9%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Plant Data CRUD uses basic model (/api/v1/farm/plant-data)
- Enhanced Plant Data uses advanced model (/api/v1/farm/plant-data-enhanced) - UI uses this
- Plant data soft delete: sets isActive=false, does NOT remove from MongoDB
- Farm delete: hard deletes from farms collection, archives to deleted_farms
- CSV template endpoint: /api/v1/farm/plant-data/template/csv (not /template)
- Test admin: farmtest_admin@a64core.com / TestAdmin123@ (role: admin)

  - Test data cleaned up after verification
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- frontend/user-portal/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx - Fixed responsive breakpoints
- frontend/user-portal/src/stores/auth.store.ts - Added cross-tab session sync

CURRENT STATUS: 33/310 features passing (10.6%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Dashboard responsive layout uses viewport-width breakpoints, not container-width
- Cross-tab session sync uses window 'storage' event (fires in OTHER tabs only)
- Auth store persists user + isAuthenticated to localStorage via Zustand persist

Agent: Features #31, #33, #32 (Dashboard Rendering, Drag-and-Drop, Stat Cards)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #31: Dashboard page renders for authenticated user [PASSING]
  - Logged in as testadmin@a64core.com, navigated to /dashboard
  - All 6 widgets visible (4 stat cards + 2 charts)
  - Zero console errors
  - Screenshot verification taken

- Feature #33: Dashboard widget drag-and-drop layout [PASSING]
  - Uses react-grid-layout with GridLayout component
  - Edit mode toggle: "Edit Layout" button enables isDraggable/isResizable
  - Drag widget → onDragStop saves layout to Zustand store
  - Layout persisted to localStorage via Zustand persist middleware (key: dashboard-storage)
  - Page refresh preserves custom layout positions (verified with screenshot)
  - Fixed multiple issues:
    - compactType="vertical" + preventCollision={false} for working drag
    - onDragStop/onResizeStop instead of onLayoutChange (prevents mount overwrite)
    - useLayoutEffect for synchronous container width measurement
    - Conditional GridLayout render: only when gridWidth > 0 && widgets.length > 0 && layout.length > 0
    - waitForHydration() ensures Zustand persist has loaded before loadDashboard runs
  - Zero console errors

- Feature #32: Dashboard stat card widgets display real data [PASSING]
  - Total Farms: 9 (matches /api/v1/farm/dashboard/summary)
  - Total Blocks: 277 with 277 Active, 0 Empty

  - All data from real aggregated API endpoints, no mock data patterns
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- frontend/user-portal/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx:
  - Replaced WidthProvider with manual useLayoutEffect width measurement
  - Added gridWidth > 0 && widgets.length > 0 && layout.length > 0 guard for GridLayout render
  - Changed onLayoutChange to onDragStop/onResizeStop (prevents layout overwrite on mount)
  - Added responsive column adjustment useEffect with prevColumnsRef guard
  - Removed unused WidgetGrid/WidgetWrapper styled components
- frontend/user-portal/src/stores/dashboard.store.ts:
  - Added waitForHydration() helper for Zustand persist hydration timing
  - Ensures stored layout is available before loadDashboard validates it

CURRENT STATUS: 34/310 features passing (11.0%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Dashboard drag-and-drop works: enter Edit mode, drag widgets, click Done, layout persists
- Layout stored in localStorage under key "dashboard-storage" (Zustand persist)
- GridLayout requires all three conditions to render: gridWidth, widgets, and layout
- The waitForHydration pattern prevents race condition with Zustand persist + async loadDashboard
- Test user: testadmin@a64core.com / TestPass123@ (role: user)
