**Fruiting Stage:**
- **Critical:** Higher potassium and phosphorus to encourage fruit production over foliage
- NPK 5-10-10 or 8-16-16
- Reduce nitrogen to avoid excessive leaf growth

**Hydroponic Solution:**
- Start: Low EC during early growth
- Fruiting: Increase to 2.0-2.5 mS/cm
- Focus on K for fruit development

### Hydroponic Parameters

   - Prevention: Beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings), reflective mulches
   - Treatment: Insecticidal soap, neem oil, strong water spray

2. **Thrips** (HIGH severity)
   - Vectors for Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (highly infectious)
   - Symptoms: Silvery streaks on leaves, distorted growth
   - Prevention: Row covers, reflective mulches, eliminate weeds
   - Treatment: Spinosad, insecticidal soap

3. **Whiteflies** (MEDIUM severity)
   - Symptoms: Yellowing leaves, honeydew, sooty mold

### IPM Strategies
- Use row covers early in season to exclude pests
- Introduce beneficial insects (lacewings, lady beetles, parasitic wasps)
- Reflective mulches deter aphids and thrips
- Avoid overhead watering to reduce disease
- Proper spacing for air circulation
- Monitor regularly and act early when pests detected
- Rotate crops - avoid planting in same location as tomatoes, eggplants, potatoes

### Companion Planting
- **Beneficial:** Basil, Carrots, Onions, Spinach, Tomatoes, Eggplant, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Marigolds, Nasturtiums, Borage
- **Incompatible:** Beans, Fennel, Brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage), Potatoes

### UAE Adaptations
- **Season:** Warm season - February to May, September to November (similar to tomatoes)
- **Planting Months:** February, March, April, September, October
