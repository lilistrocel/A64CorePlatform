# Cross-Platform Implementation Complete

## Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

All code, scripts, and tools in the A64 Core Platform have been made **cross-platform compatible**, working on both **Windows** and **Linux** (and macOS where applicable).

This addresses the critical requirement: **"Everything we create should be able to run on both Windows and Linux"**

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility Standards (CLAUDE.md)

**Location:** `CLAUDE.md` (Lines 21-164, 140+ lines)

**Added comprehensive cross-platform requirements:**
- ✅ 10 Cross-Platform Rules (paths, scripts, line endings, environment variables, etc.)
- ✅ Cross-Platform Testing Checklist (9 items)
- ✅ Preferred Solutions (Python scripts, Docker, pathlib)
- ✅ Platform Support Matrix (Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS)
- ✅ Example cross-platform Python script template

**Key Rules:**
1. Use `pathlib.Path` or `os.path.join` for all file paths
2. Provide scripts in both `.sh` AND `.bat/.ps1`, OR use Python (preferred)
3. Configure `.gitattributes` for line endings (LF)
4. Use cross-platform environment variable methods
5. Check command availability before execution
6. Docker works on all platforms
7. Handle file permissions gracefully (Windows has no chmod)
8. Use consistent file casing (Windows case-insensitive, Linux case-sensitive)
9. Test on both platforms, use GitHub Actions
10. Provide documentation for both platforms

### 2. Python-Based Performance Test Script

**File:** `tests/performance/quick_perf_test.py` (400+ lines)

**Platform Support:**
- ✅ Windows 10/11
- ✅ Linux (all distributions)
- ✅ macOS

**Features:**
- Pure Python implementation (no external tools like Apache Bench)
- Cross-platform colored output using `colorama`
- Command-line arguments for configuration
- Concurrent request testing using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Detailed performance metrics (avg, median, p95, p99)
- Automatic platform detection using `platform.system()`

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests colorama
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Windows
python tests\performance\quick_perf_test.py

# Linux/Mac
python3 tests/performance/quick_perf_test.py

# Custom configuration
python quick_perf_test.py --url http://localhost:8000 --requests 2000 --concurrency 20
```

**Tests Performed:**
1. Health endpoint (baseline performance)
2. Readiness endpoint (with database check)
3. User registration (write operations)
4. API documentation (static content)

**Metrics Provided:**
- Total requests / Successful / Failed
- Error rate (%)
- Requests per second
- Response times: Average, Median, Min, Max, P95, P99
- Color-coded output based on performance targets
