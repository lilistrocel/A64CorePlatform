- frontend/user-portal/src/stores/dashboard.store.ts - Fixed refreshWidget/refreshAllWidgets cache busting

CURRENT STATUS: 52/310 features passing (16.8%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- StatWidget now supports individual refresh via onRefresh prop (same as ChartWidget)
- Dashboard refresh uses queryClient.removeQueries() to bust React Query cache
- Test admin: farmtest_admin@a64core.com / TestAdmin123@ (role: admin)

Agent: Features #114, #115, #116 (Date Sorting, Timestamps, Empty Search)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #114: Date sorting works across month/year boundaries [PASSING]
  - Created 4 test orders with dates: Dec 15 2024, Dec 31 2024, Jan 1 2025, Jan 15 2025

  - OrderTable, EmployeeTable, VehicleTable, CustomerTable all use same pattern
  - Zero console errors, test data cleaned up

- Feature #115: CreatedAt and updatedAt timestamps accurate [PASSING]
  - Created test farm TIMESTAMP_TEST_FARM_115
  - createdAt within 0.008 seconds of client-side timestamp (well within 5 sec)
  - updatedAt nearly equals createdAt on creation (1 microsecond difference)
  - After PATCH update: createdAt unchanged (still 17:24:51.044000)
  - After PATCH update: updatedAt changed to 17:25:08.585000 (17.5 sec newer)
  - GET after update confirms both timestamps persisted correctly
  - Zero console errors, test farm cleaned up

- Feature #116: Search with empty string returns all results [PASSING]
  - Farm list: typed "Liwa" -> 1 farm shown, cleared to "" -> all 9 farms shown
  - Employee list: typed "Belal" -> 3 employees shown, cleared to "" -> all 156 employees (Page 1 of 8)
  - Farm search uses client-side filter: `includes('')` always returns true
  - Employee search uses server-side: empty string converted to undefined, backend returns all
  - Zero console errors

CURRENT STATUS: 51/310 features passing (16.5%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Date sorting uses new Date().getTime() in all table components (client-side)
- Farm search is client-side (filter on fetched data)
- Employee search is server-side (API query param)
- Docker containers may restart unexpectedly - check with docker ps
- Test admin: farmtest_admin@a64core.com / TestAdmin123@ (role: admin)

- Can be called from outside React components (used in axios interceptor)
- Toast uses 5s auto-dismiss by default, configurable via duration parameter
- Campaign CRUD fully works: create, read, update, delete with UI at /marketing/campaigns
- Test admin: farmtest_admin@a64core.com / TestAdmin123@ (role: admin)

== Session: 2026-02-05 (Agent 11) ==
Agent: Features #49, #301, #208 (Plant Data CRUD, CSV Template, Real DB Verification)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #49: Plant data library CRUD [PASSING]
  - Full CRUD tested via /api/v1/farm/plant-data endpoints
  - CREATE: POST with plantName, scientificName, plantType, growthCycleDays, yieldUnit etc → 201
  - READ (List): GET with search parameter → returns matching plants with pagination
  - READ (By ID): GET /{plantDataId} → returns full plant data
  - UPDATE (PATCH): Updates fields, increments dataVersion (v1→v2)
  - DELETE: Soft delete (sets isActive=false), removed from list results
  - Fixed: Default list query now excludes soft-deleted plants (isActive != false)
  - UI verified: Plant Data Library page at /farm/plants shows 48 real plants
  - Zero console errors, no mock data patterns

- Feature #301: CSV template download returns valid template [PASSING]

  - Deleted farm archived in deleted_farms collection (cascade deletion service)
  - Farm list UI shows 9 real farms, test farm properly removed
  - Zero mock data patterns in src/ and frontend/ (grep verified)
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- src/modules/farm_manager/services/plant_data/plant_data_repository.py:
  - get_all() now defaults to exclude isActive=False records (soft-deleted plants)
  - Previously, default list showed all plants including soft-deleted ones

CURRENT STATUS: 43/310 features passing (13.9%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Plant Data CRUD uses basic model (/api/v1/farm/plant-data)
- Enhanced Plant Data uses advanced model (/api/v1/farm/plant-data-enhanced) - UI uses this
- Plant data soft delete: sets isActive=false, does NOT remove from MongoDB
- Farm delete: hard deletes from farms collection, archives to deleted_farms
- CSV template endpoint: /api/v1/farm/plant-data/template/csv (not /template)
- Test admin: farmtest_admin@a64core.com / TestAdmin123@ (role: admin)
- MongoDB auth: use mongosh without auth from within container, or check docker-compose for creds
- Spacing categories: xs, s, m, l, xl, bush, large_bush, small_tree, medium_tree, large_tree

  - Test data cleaned up after verification
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- frontend/user-portal/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx - Fixed responsive breakpoints
- frontend/user-portal/src/stores/auth.store.ts - Added cross-tab session sync

CURRENT STATUS: 33/310 features passing (10.6%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:

Agent: Features #31, #33, #32 (Dashboard Rendering, Drag-and-Drop, Stat Cards)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #31: Dashboard page renders for authenticated user [PASSING]
  - Logged in as testadmin@a64core.com, navigated to /dashboard
  - All 6 widgets visible (4 stat cards + 2 charts)
  - Zero console errors
  - Screenshot verification taken

- Feature #33: Dashboard widget drag-and-drop layout [PASSING]
  - Uses react-grid-layout with GridLayout component
  - Edit mode toggle: "Edit Layout" button enables isDraggable/isResizable
  - Drag widget → onDragStop saves layout to Zustand store
  - Layout persisted to localStorage via Zustand persist middleware (key: dashboard-storage)
  - Page refresh preserves custom layout positions (verified with screenshot)
  - Fixed multiple issues:
    - compactType="vertical" + preventCollision={false} for working drag
    - onDragStop/onResizeStop instead of onLayoutChange (prevents mount overwrite)
    - useLayoutEffect for synchronous container width measurement
    - Conditional GridLayout render: only when gridWidth > 0 && widgets.length > 0 && layout.length > 0
    - waitForHydration() ensures Zustand persist has loaded before loadDashboard runs
  - Zero console errors

- Feature #32: Dashboard stat card widgets display real data [PASSING]
  - Total Farms: 9 (matches /api/v1/farm/dashboard/summary)
  - Total Blocks: 277 with 277 Active, 0 Empty

  - All data from real aggregated API endpoints, no mock data patterns
  - Zero console errors

FIXES APPLIED:
- frontend/user-portal/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx:
  - Replaced WidthProvider with manual useLayoutEffect width measurement
  - Added gridWidth > 0 && widgets.length > 0 && layout.length > 0 guard for GridLayout render
  - Changed onLayoutChange to onDragStop/onResizeStop (prevents layout overwrite on mount)
  - Added responsive column adjustment useEffect with prevColumnsRef guard
  - Removed unused WidgetGrid/WidgetWrapper styled components
- frontend/user-portal/src/stores/dashboard.store.ts:
  - Added waitForHydration() helper for Zustand persist hydration timing
  - Ensures stored layout is available before loadDashboard validates it

CURRENT STATUS: 34/310 features passing (11.0%)

NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- Dashboard drag-and-drop works: enter Edit mode, drag widgets, click Done, layout persists
- Layout stored in localStorage under key "dashboard-storage" (Zustand persist)
- GridLayout requires all three conditions to render: gridWidth, widgets, and layout
- The waitForHydration pattern prevents race condition with Zustand persist + async loadDashboard
