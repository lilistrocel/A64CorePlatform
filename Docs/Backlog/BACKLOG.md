## Rules for Agents

### Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `🟢 Ready` | Available for implementation, no blockers |
| `🔵 Active` | Currently being worked on (check assignee) |
| `🔴 Blocked` | Waiting on dependencies to complete first |
| `✅ Done` | Completed and verified (moved to ARCHIVE.md) |

### Before Starting Work

1. **READ this file** before any implementation
2. Find a task with status `🟢 Ready`
3. **NEVER** work on `🔵 Active` tasks — already claimed by another agent
4. **NEVER** work on `🔴 Blocked` tasks — dependencies are unresolved
5. If no relevant task exists, **create one first** before starting work

### Claiming a Task

1. Change status from `🟢 Ready` to `🔵 Active`
2. Set `Assigned:` to your agent type (e.g., backend-dev-expert)
3. Set `Started:` to today's date
4. **One agent per task** — no shared ownership

### Completing a Task

1. Move the task entry from this file to [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md)
2. Check: does this task appear in any other task's `Depends on:` field?
3. If ALL dependencies of a blocked task are now `✅ Done`, change it to `🟢 Ready`
4. Update the stats in the header of this file

### Creating New Tasks

- Use next available `T-XXX` ID (check both BACKLOG.md and ARCHIVE.md for highest ID)
- Set dependencies if this task requires other tasks to complete first
- **Categories:** Backend, Frontend, API, Database, Testing, DevOps, Docs
- **Priorities:** P0 (critical) · P1 (high) · P2 (medium) · P3 (low)

### Session Handoff

- If a session ends before task completion, add `> Context:` notes to the task
- Keep status as `🔵 Active` with context notes for the next session
- Next session reads task notes and continues from where it left off
